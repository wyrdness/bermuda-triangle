      "summary": "A loosely defined region in the western North Atlantic Ocean where ships and aircraft have allegedly disappeared under mysterious circumstances. The area roughly forms a triangle between Miami, Bermuda, and Puerto Rico.",
      "full": "The Bermuda Triangle is a region in the western Atlantic Ocean where numerous ships and aircraft have disappeared under circumstances that have been characterized as mysterious or unexplained. The term was coined by writer Vincent Gaddis in 1964. The boundaries of the triangle cover approximately 500,000 square miles of ocean between Miami (Florida), Bermuda, and San Juan (Puerto Rico). Reports include compass malfunctions, electronic failures, unusual weather phenomena, and complete disappearances without distress signals. While many attribute these incidents to paranormal or extraterrestrial causes, skeptics point to statistical analysis, human error, and natural oceanographic and meteorological phenomena as explanations. The U.S. Coast Guard and other maritime authorities do not recognize the Bermuda Triangle as particularly hazardous compared to other heavily-traveled ocean regions."
